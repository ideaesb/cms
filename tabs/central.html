		</ul>


    <p><strong>Regional climate centers</strong></p>
	<ul>
		<li><a target="_blank" href="http://mrcc.isws.illinois.edu/">Midwest Regional Climate Center</a>.  The MRCC serves the nine-state Midwest region (Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Ohio, and Wisconsin). Our services and research help to better explain climate and its impacts on the Midwest, provide practical solutions to specific climate problems, and allow us to develop climate information for the Midwest on climate-sensitive issues such as agriculture, climate change, energy, the environment, human health, risk management, transportation, and water resources.</li>
		<li><a target="_blank" href="http://www.hprcc.unl.edu/">High Plains Regional Climate Center</a></li>.  The mission of the High Plains Regional Climate Center is to increase the use and availability of climate data in the High Plains region (Nebraska, Kansas, South Dakota, North Dakota, Wyoming and Colorado).&nbsp; HPRCC personnel work closely with scientists from other regional and federal climate centers on climate services and programs and provide a regional structure for climate applications. The long-term objectives of the HPRCC are to carry out applied climate studies, develop improved climate information products, and provide climate services in the High Plains region.</li>
	<li><a target="_blank" href="http://www.doi.gov/csc/index.cfm">Department of Interior Climate Science Centers</a>.  The North Central and Northeast Science Centers (CSCs) provide scientific information, tools and techniques that land, water, wildlife and cultural resource managers and other interested parties can apply to anticipate, monitor and adapt to climate and ecologically-driven responses at regional-to-local scales. CSCs deliver basic climate change impact science within their respective regions, including physical and biological research, ecological forecasting, and multi-scale modeling. CSCs will prioritize their delivery of fundamental science, data and decision support activities to provide climate change impact information on natural and cultural resources and to develop adaptive management and other decision support tools for managers. &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
	<li><a target="_blank" href="http://www.doi.gov/lcc/index.cfm">Landscape Conservation Cooperatives</a>.  The eight landscape conservation cooperatives (LCCs) that intersect with NOAA’s Central Region for climate services support applied conservation science partnerships with two main functions. The first is to provide the science and technical expertise needed to support conservation planning at landscape scales – beyond the reach or resources of any one organization. The second function of LCCs is to promote collaboration among their members in defining shared conservation goals. LCCs don’t place limits on partners; rather, they help partners to see how their activities can "fit" with those of other partners to achieve a bigger and more lasting impact.</li>
