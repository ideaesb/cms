<p>Welcome to the NOAA National Climatic Data Center's (NCDC) Regional Climate Services Directors Home Page.</p>

<p>NCDC's six Regional Climate Services Directors (RCSDs) support the development and delivery of a wide range of place-based climate science and information products and services to help people make informed decisions. RCSDs regularly communicate with stakeholders about climate information needs, and help build and strengthen active partner networks with public and private constituents. They play a primary role in integrating the work within NOAA and among its partners engaged in developing and delivering climate services at the regional level, including the Regional Integrated Sciences and Assessment programs, Regional Climate Centers, state climatologists, the National Integrated Drought Information System as well as other agencies, institutions, and organizations. These efforts serve to increase the value of climate information to users and support more efficient, cost-effective delivery of products and services.</p>
