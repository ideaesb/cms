<p>Welcome to the Regional Climate Services Directors (RCSD) Home Page. The RCSD work to build and strengthen regional partnerships to better assess and deliver regionally-focused climate science and information products and services to help people make informed decisions in their lives, businesses and communities. Specifically, their mission is to integrate the work of various NOAA partners engaged in developing and delivering climate science and services at the regional level<strong>, </strong>including the Regional Integrated Sciences and Assessment programs, Regional Climate Centers, state climatologists and many partners across the private and public sector. Integrating the work of these assets increase value to users and support more efficient, cost-effective delivery of services. The directors work for NOAA’s National Climatic Data Center in Asheville, NC. However, each director is based at NOAA’s six National Weather Service regional headquarters offices. This co-location ensures close coordination between NOAA’s weather and climate services.</p>

<p>The directors are:</p>

	<li>Ellen Mecray, Eastern Region, Bohemia, New York</li>
	<li>Doug Kluck, Central Region, Kansas City, Missouri</li>

<h2>Southern Region - David Brown</h2>

<p>Prior to joining NOAA, David Brown served as assistant professor of geography at Louisiana State University, and as assistant professor of geography and New Hampshire state climatologist at the University of New Hampshire. He holds doctorate and master’s degrees in geography from the University of Arizona and a bachelor’s degree in meteorology from Penn State University. For over a decade, he has been active in the climate services community as a researcher, state climatologist and member of three NOAA Regional Integrated Sciences and Assessments (RISA) projects. Most recently he was an investigator with the Southern Climate Impacts Planning Program, the first RISA to co-locate and formalize research, operations and outreach linkages to both a NOAA regional climate center and a state climatologist office. His research interests include synoptic and applied climatology, human-environment interactions, and global climate change, and his work has been published in a number of scientific journals including the <em>International Journal of Climatology</em>, <em>Climate Research</em>, <em>Journal of Geophysical Research</em>, <em>Geophysical Research Letters</em> and the <em>Professional Geographer</em>. He is also an accomplished educator, having taught introductory, advanced and graduate courses in climatology, meteorology and physical geography at three universities.</p>
