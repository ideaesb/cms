<h2><a id="partners" name="partners">Regional Partners</a><a href="http://www.rcsdhome.org/node/4" style="float:right">Top</a></h2>

<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.srh.noaa.gov/" target="_blank">NWS Southern Region</a>. With 33 Weather Forecast Offices (WFO) and 4 River Forecast Centers (RFC) in its domain, the NWS Southern Region is uniquely positioned to serve as the local and state conduit for providing operational-scale climate data, forecasts, and information to its partners. This is especially relevant from a perspective of providing decision support services to these partners to assist them with adapting to their impacts of climate change and climate variability. Each WFO and RFC has an identified Climate Service Focal Point (CSFP) to support this role as well as a regional Climate Services Program Manager (CSPM).</li>
	<li><a href="http://sero.nmfs.noaa.gov/" target="_blank">NMFS Southeast Regional Office (SERO)</a>. The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS or NOAA Fisheries Service) is dedicated to the stewardship of living marine resources through science-based conservation and management, and the promotion of healthy ecosystems. As a steward, NMFS conserves, protects, and manages living marine resources in a way that ensures their continuation as functioning components of marine ecosystems, affords economic opportunities, and enhances the quality of life for the American public. The geography of SERO encompasses 17 States and two Territories. SERO serves primarily a policy and regulatory function so it is more of a client for rather than a developer of climate services across the marine, coastal, and freshwater systems. Needs include regionally-scaled predictions for SE and Caribbean SST increases and OA, water supply variability in SE rivers, and SLR, coastal inundation and resulting coastal armoring; improved guidance on how to factor in global issues in local/regional evaluations and management actions (ESA, M-SA, NEPA); and how to address climate change (mostly in terms of predicted SLR) in evaluating projects for long-term ecosystem impacts and designing large-scale restoration projects.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.regions.noaa.gov/gulf-mexico/" target="_blank">NOAA Gulf of Mexico Regional Collaboration Team</a>. The Gulf region has myriad capabilities and expertise both within NOAA (including Sea Grant and Cooperative Institutes) and through extended partnerships with other federal and state resource agencies, the Gulf of Mexico Alliance, regional universities, NGOs, and other partner organizations. The NOAA Gulf of Mexico Regional Collaboration Team helps bring these constituents together to collectively address major challenges to healthy and resilient communities in the Gulf region.  This diverse expertise is reflected in the Team’s composition, with members from across the region and all Line Offices.  The strength of each component is amplified by the regional collaboration effort, which brings together efforts from across the agency in combination with those of partners to accomplish larger-picture outcomes.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.regions.noaa.gov/secar/" target="_blank">NOAA Southeast and Caribbean Regional Collaboration Team</a>. One of 8 NOAA regional collaboration teams, the Southeast and Caribbean Regional Team (SECART) strives to improve the delivery of NOAA products and services to the region through improved communication, coordination and collaboration among NOAA offices and with partners within the region and by focusing NOAA’s capabilities on the region’s issues. The SECART region is NC, SC, GA, FL, and the US Caribbean. SECART has a &quot;climate workgroup&quot; or sub-team that focuses on climate issues in the region and allows us to reach out to additional (beyond team members) expertise in the region.</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.northerngulfinstitute.org/" target="_blank">Northern Gulf Institute</a>. The Northern Gulf Institute (NGI) is a partnership of Mississippi State University, the University of Southern Mississippi, Florida State University, Louisiana State University, the Alabama Dauphin Island Sea Laboratory, and NOAA. NGI engages nationally and internationally-recognized academic experts who conduct research that builds an integrated, comprehensive understanding of natural and human impacts on northern Gulf of Mexico ecosystems and associated economies in order to improve its management.</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.ci-mas.org/" target="_blank">Cooperative Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Studies</a>. The Cooperative Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Studies (CIMAS) based at the University of Miami, within the Rosenstiel School of Marine & Atmospheric Science, brings together the research and educational resources of nine major public and private research universities in Florida and the U.S. Caribbean to further NOAA’s mssion by providing a Center of Excellence relevant to understanding the Earth’s oceans and atmosphere.  One of our main themes is Climate Research and Impacts which is defined as research focused upon understanding oceanic and atmospheric processes associated with global and regional climate change on various temporal scales and the impacts of climate variability and change.  Activities under this theme include research to determine effective regional adaptation strategies, and developing and studying new climate information products and tools appropriate for evolving user needs, including real-time predictions and forecasts.  Other CIMAS themes (e.g., Ocean Modeling, Sustained Observations and Ecosystem Modeling) also have major climate components.</li>
    <li><a href="http://stormsmart.org/groups/gcva/" target="_blank">Gulf of Mexico landscape conservation</a>. The purpose of this partnership is to advance the DOI and NOAA shared goals of conservation and climate change adaptation planning in the Gulf Coast region by providing coordination and outreach across multiple programs and partnerships and by developing regionally specific coastal conservation strategies and assessments that incorporate planning for climate change.</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.doi.gov/csc/index.cfm" target="_blank">Department of Interior Climate Science Centers</a>. The South Central and Southeast Climate Science Centers (CSCs) provide scientific information, tools and techniques that land, water, wildlife and cultural resource managers and other interested parties can apply to anticipate, monitor and adapt to climate and ecologically-driven responses at regional-to-local scales. CSCs deliver basic climate change impact science within their respective regions, including physical and biological research, ecological forecasting, and multi-scale modeling. CSCs will prioritize their delivery of fundamental science, data and decision support activities to provide climate change impact information on natural and cultural resources and to develop adaptive management and other decision support tools for managers.</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.doi.gov/lcc/index.cfm" target="_blank">Landscape Conservation Cooperatives</a>. The ten landscape conservation cooperatives (LCCs) that intersect with NOAA’s Southern Region for climate services support applied conservation science partnerships with two main functions. The first is to provide the science and technical expertise needed to support conservation planning at landscape scales – beyond the reach or resources of any one organization. The second function of LCCs is to promote collaboration among their members in defining shared conservation goals. LCCs don’t place limits on partners; rather, they help partners to see how their activities can "fit" with those of other partners to achieve a bigger and more lasting impact.</li>
