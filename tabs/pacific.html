Marra is the NOAA Climate Services Director for the Pacific Region, based in Honolulu, Hawaii. He is also the Chair of the Pacific Climate Information System (PaCIS) and an Adjunct Fellow at the East-West Center. For over 20 years Dr. Marra has been working to bridge science, policy, and information technology to address issues related to natural hazards risk reduction and climate adaptation planning. His particular area of expertise is the development and dissemination of data and products associated with coastal inundation and erosion. Before working in his current capacity, Dr. Marra worked for the NOAA Integrated Data and Environmental Applications (IDEA) Center in Honolulu, Hawaii, where he spearheaded a project on extreme storms – strong winds, heavy rains, and high seas – in the Pacific; and at the NOAA Pacific Services Center providing technical assista</span><img alt="Sunset" height="167" src="http://www.rcsdhome.org/sites/default/files/images/sunset.jpg" style="position:relative;float:right; padding:3px;" /><span style="line-height: 1.33em;">nce to Pacific Island jurisdictions and supporting the integration of multi-disciplinary research and observations to address issues associated with coastal natural hazards and community resilience. Before arriving in Hawaii in April 2002 he worked independently for almost 10 years in Newport, Oregon as a consulting geologist for a broad range of private and public sector clients.
