<h2><a id="partners" name="partners">Regional Partners</a><a href="http://www.rcsdhome.org/node/3" style="float:right">Top</a></h2>
<p><strong>Federal Partnerships</strong></p>

<p>Agencies have organized a number of collaborative efforts in the Eastern Region that address NOAA priorities.&nbsp; The value of these efforts include information sharing, building trust among participants, improving communication, understanding of individual missions and activities, and leveraging resources and capacities. These include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>International partner: The <a href="http://www.gulfofmaine.org/2/committees-and-programs/climate-change-network/">Gulf of Maine Council Climate Network (GOMC/CN)</a> is a bi-lateral group of federal, state, and provincial leaders working together to address climate concerns in the Gulf of Maine and the Eastern Region bordering with Quebec and the 4 maritime provinces of Canada.&nbsp; NOAA (RCSD) was appointed as the US lead, with Met-Canada’s Atlantic director as the Canadian co-lead. The group is formed around multiple sectors and the need to work across boundaries and discuss common actions.</li>
	<li>The <u>New England Federal Partners (NEFP)</u> is an affiliation of 16 federal agencies operating in New England that meets regularly to consider climate adaptation and mitigation, ocean planning and coordinated communication and engagement. The purpose of the group is to facilitate cross-agency communication, cooperation, coordination, and collaboration in support of stakeholders including states and local governments.</li>
	<li>The <u>Federal Climate Partners for the Mid-Atlantic (FCP)</u> was re-formed in 2013 from the original group focused specifically on NY and NJ. The group now includes about 14 Federal agencies supporting climate activities across the Mid-Atlantic sub-region (NY-VA).&nbsp; The group meets regularly by telecom and in-person to facilitate communication and cooperation across Federal agencies in support of climate needs expressed by the two member states.</li>
	<li>The <u>Mid-Atlantic Federal Partners for the Oceans (MAFPO)</u>is an informal body created to increase federal coordination towards shared coastal and ocean management priorities identified by MARCO.&nbsp; MAFPO calls are convened by NOAA (CSC mid-Atlantic coordinator) every two to three months.</li>
	<li>The <a href="http://www.epa.gov/region4/topics/envmanagement/senrlg/index.htm">Southeast Natural Resources Leadership Group (SENRLG)</a> is an informal federal interagency body working to promote efficient and effective federal partnerships in the southeast.&nbsp; The group is leading a GIS-based analysis of federal efforts being undertaken in the region, with a pilot project in the Ablemarle-Pamlico Sound area. Their methods and rationale lead to support from the South Atlantic LCC in FY12.</li>
	<li>The <a href="http://serppas.org">Southeast Regional Partnership for Planning and Sustainability (SERPPAS)</a> is primarily lead by DOD agencies, with some input from EPA and NOAA. The focus is on habitat conservation and sustainable ecosystems, on DOD lands primarily.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Federal/State Partnerships</strong></p>

<p>There are a number of collaborative efforts that meet with state-level sectoral focus areas in the Eastern Region.&nbsp; The value of these efforts include sharing information, building trust among participants, improving communication, understanding individual missions and activities, and leveraging resources and capacities. These include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The <a href="http://northeastoceancouncil.org">Northeast Regional Ocean Council (NROC)</a>: The Northeast Regional Ocean Council (NROC) is a state and federal partnership with the goal of engaging in regional protection and balanced use of ocean and coastal resources.&nbsp; In 2005, the six New England governors created NROC to facilitate the development and implementation of coordinated and collaborative regional goals and priorities to improve responses to coastal issues and challenges that are inherently regional<em>.</em></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.midatlanticocean.org">Mid-Atlantic Regional Council on the Ocean (MARCO)</a>: In June 2009, the Governors of NY, NJ, DE, MD, and VA committed to a new comprehensive, regional approach, pledging to work to maintain and improve the health of their collective ocean and coastal resources, and ensure that they continue to contribute to the high quality of life and economic vitality of our region’s communities well into the future.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>The<a href="http://www.southatlanticalliance.org">Governors’ South Atlantic Alliance (GSAA)</a> was formed with the gubernatorial leads of NC, SC, GA, and FL to focus on a regional approach to managing coastal ecosystems and habitats. The partnership is state-led, with federal partners from coastal-related agencies.</li>
	<li>The <a href="http://www.fws.gov/landscape-conservation/lcc.html">Landscape Conservation Cooperatives (LCCs)</a> &nbsp;(<a href="http://www.applcc.org">Appalachian LCC</a>, <a href="http://www.northatlanticlcc.org">North Atlantic LCC</a>, and <a href="http://www.southatlanticlcc.org">South Atlantic LCC</a>) are led by steering committees comprised of representatives from the state fish and wildlife agencies, conservation and wildlife-related NGOs, as well as federal agencies.</li>
	<li>The <a href="http://necsc.umass.edu">DOI/Northeast Climate Science Center (DOI/CSC)</a> started activity in FY12 with appointments to an advisory team and a call for proposals. In FY13, the DOI/CSC lead calls for proposals and disseminated about $650k towards climate-related research supporting the LCCs.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Federal/Academic Partnerships</strong></p>

<p>There are a number of NOAA-funded partners in the academic realm that work in partnership with the climate programs across the agency to produce research products, conduct stakeholder engagement sessions, and produce operational products for customers across all sectors in the climate realm.</p>

<ul>
	<li><a target="_blank" href="http://ccrun.org">Consortium for Climate Risk in the Urban Northeast (RISA/CCRUN)</a>. The CCRUN group is part of the NOAA Regional Integrated Sciences and Assessment program with the Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research (OAR/RISA). The group includes experts in climate modeling, urban infrastructure and vulnerability assessments, hydrologic risks from a changing climate, coastal modeling and storm surge, and evaluation of effective scientific programs.&nbsp; The university members include: Columbia University, Drexel University, University of Massachusetts, Stevens Institute of Technology, and Hunter College.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><a target="_blank" href="http://www.cisa.sc.edu/index.html">Carolinas Regional Integrated Sciences and Assessments (CISA)</a>. The CISA group is located at the University of South Carolina. The principle investigators at CISA work to incorporate climate information into water and coastal management and related decision-making processes. These efforts specifically include adaptation to drought, linking climate variability to watershed/land-use planning, coastal adaptation planning, and characterizing climate vulnerability in the region.</li>
	<li><a target="_blank" href="http://www.nrcc.cornell.edu">Northeast Regional Climate Center (NRCC)</a>. The NRCC is located at Cornell University and works to acquire and disseminate NOAA’s climate data and information across the region from WV to ME. The NRCC offers operational climate products and access to regional datasets from the National Climatic Data Center.&nbsp; Additionally, the NRCC has hosted workshops on their gridded datasets, on regional climate impacts, and the regional rollout of the national climate assessment.</li>
	<li><a target="_blank" href="http://www.sercc.com">Southeast Regional Climate Center (SERCC)</a>. The SERCC is located at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The director and his staff offer NOAA climate products to the NC and SC portion of the eastern region, including specialized products for the human health sector. The SERCC was a major contributor to the climatologies used in the southeast chapter of the National Climate Assessment, accessible from their website.</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>Internal NOAA Partnerships</strong></p>

<p>There are also necessarily internal engagements supporting raised awareness across line offices and support planning and execution of climate issues in a coordinated regional manner.</p>

<ul>
	<li>The <u>Eastern Region Climate Team (ERCT)</u> was formed in 2009 by the RCSD in order to broadly represent the NOAA climate assets in the eastern region.&nbsp; The RCSD convenes the team monthly by conference call with representatives from each of the NOAA line offices and close partners.&nbsp; Call agendas are intended to build internal awareness, and create NOAA ambassadors better able to represent the agency’s broad mission areas in interagency forums. The ERCT also serves to review and edit regional reports including the CEQ tasker (FY12) for NOAA climate in the region as well as the needs assessment, the regional website, the quarterly climate outlooks, and the regional climate action plan. The group also proposes regional climate activities that can be leveraged with the NOAA regional collaboration teams and their annual budget preparations.</li>
	<li><a target="_blank" href="http://www.regions.noaa.gov/main/">NOAA’s Regional Collaboration Teams (RCTs)</a> are convened by a regional team lead and a coordinator.&nbsp; These teams each host monthly calls and annual or semi-annual face-to-face team meetings. The RCTs report to NOAA’s Program Planning and Integration line office as well as to an Executive Oversight Group made of line office leads from across NOAA. RCSD is lead for climate for 3 of these teams: The <a target="_blank" href="http://www.regions.noaa.gov/north-atlantic/?page_id=22">North Atlantic Regional Team (NART)</a> includes the sub-region from ME to VA.
