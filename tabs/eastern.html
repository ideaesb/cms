<p><strong>STRATEGIC PLAN:</strong></p>

<p><strong>VISION</strong>:&nbsp;A robust network of scientists and decision-makers poised to implement adaptive strategies that prepare NOAA’s Eastern region for climate change.</p>

<p><strong>MISSION</strong>:&nbsp; Engage NOAA with government and sector groups addressing climate change impacts at multiple scales to leverage resources, maintain landscape-scale coordination, and target NOAA’s existing climate services toward outstanding needs for climate information.</p>

<p><strong>OBJECTIVES</strong>:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Reduce redundancy, coordinating resources towards common regional needs and unified products;</li>
	<li>Coordinate execution of regional projects and activities to meet the needs of all stakeholders;</li>
	<li>Ensure representation of NOAA in regional organizations (Federal, State, Collaborative) to facilitate information sharing and increase regional capacity;</li>
	<li>Assess cross-sector needs for climate information within the region; and</li>
	<li>Maintain regional web portal,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.neclimateus.org/" target="_blank">NEclimateUS.org</a>, to deliver relevant climate information, connect climate-focused partners, and facilitate climate adaptation activities within the region's 16 states.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Eastern Region - Ellen Mecray</h2>

<p><img src="http://www.rcsdhome.org/sites/default/files/images/mecray.jpg" style="border:0; float:left; height:169px; margin:1px; width:222px" />For the last four years, Ellen Mecray led strategic planning for NOAA’s Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research and facilitated inter-and intra-agency dialog and collaboration on climate science in New England. She is the lead for the North Atlantic Regional Collaboration Team’s Climate sub-team which consists of 20 people representing all of NOAA’s line offices and key regional partners. Prior to joining NOAA, Mecray was an oceanographer with the US Geological Survey’s Coastal and Marine Geology program in Woods Hole, Mass. Her research interests include geochemistry and coastal contaminants as well as paleo-climatic reconstructions. She is published in a number of research journals including the <em>Journal of Coastal Research</em>, <em>Environmental Geology</em> and <em>Water, Air and Soil Pollution</em>. Mecray holds a bachelor’s degree in geology from Colgate University and a master’s degree in geological oceanography from the University of Rhode Island. She is a member of the Geological Society of America, the American Geophysical Union, Geochemical Society, and Sigma Xi Honor Society.</p>
