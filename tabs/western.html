<p>Welcome to the Regional Climate Services Directors (RCSD) Home Page. The RCSD work to build and strengthen regional partnerships to better assess and deliver regionally-focused climate science and information products and services to help people make informed decisions in their lives, businesses and communities. Specifically, their mission is to integrate the work of various NOAA partners engaged in developing and delivering climate science and services at the regional level<strong>, </strong>including the Regional Integrated Sciences and Assessment programs, Regional Climate Centers, state climatologists and many partners across the private and public sector. Integrating the work of these assets increase value to users and support more efficient, cost-effective delivery of services.
