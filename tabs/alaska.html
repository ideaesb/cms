<p>Welcome to the Regional Climate Services Directors (RCSD) Home Page. The RCSD work to build and strengthen regional partnerships to better assess and deliver regionally-focused climate science and information products and services to help people make informed decisions in their lives, businesses and communities. Specifically, their mission is to integrate the work of various NOAA partners engaged in developing and delivering climate science and services at the regional level<strong>, </strong>including the Regional Integrated Sciences and Assessment programs, Regional Climate Centers, state climatologists and many partners across the private and public sector. Integrating the work of these assets increase value to users and support more efficient, cost-effective delivery of services. The directors work for NOAA’s National Climatic Data Center in Asheville, NC. However, each director is based at NOAA’s six National Weather Service regional headquarters offices. This co-location ensures close coordination between NOAA’s weather and climate services.</p>

<h2>Alaska Region - James Partain</h2>

<p>For the past 24 years, James Partain worked to improve the provision of environmental information to NOAA customers and stakeholders. As the chief of the National Weather Service’s Alaska Region Environmental and Scientific Services Division, Partain oversaw university research on a variety of climate topics, ranging from sea ice retreat to storm effects and coastal erosion. As a science fellow to the NOAA Cooperative Institute for Arctic Research, he fostered collaboration between NOAA, academia and other researchers in Alaska and the Arctic. In addition, Partain was an active member of the steering committee for the Alaska Center for Climate Assessment and Policy. As the former regional scientist for the NWS Pacific Region, James also managed the Pacific Region’s climate services program. His paper on the application of a National Centers for Environmental Prediction model to mesoscale forecasting was published in the Weather and Forecasting Journal of the American Meteorological Society, of which he is a member. Partain’s career in the NWS includes meteorologist/forecaster positions in Reno, Nev., Great Falls, Mont., Cleveland, and as the science and operations officer for the NOAA/NCEP Ocean Prediction Center. He holds a bachelor’s degree in atmospheric sciences from the University of Washington.</p>
